== Couchbase Server


In this lesson, you will install and launch version 7.0.0 of Couchbase Server.
If there is a later version available, you can download it as well bearing in mind that the instructions have been validated with the 7.0.0 version.
Note that the actual UI may vary slightly depending on the version of Couchbase server that you have installed.

* https://www.couchbase.com/downloads#couchbase-server[Download and install] v7.0.x of Couchbase Server.
Follow the instructions specified in the appropriate platform specific xref:server:install:install-intro.adoc[install guide] to install the same.

* On the setup wizard, create an Administrator account with the user _Administrator_ and password as __password__.
+

== Sync Gateway


In this section, you will install and launch version 3.0.0 of Sync Gateway.

* Download Sync Gateway 3.0.0 from
https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[here]
for your platform

* The Sync Gateway will have to be launched with the config file named `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` that you should have downloaded as per the instructions in the <<Workshop Repo>> section.
The config file will be located in `/path/to/mobile-travel-sample`.

* Open the `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` and confirm that the RBAC user credentials configured on the Couchbase Server are used by Sync Gateway for accessing the bucket
+
[source,json]
----
"username": "admin",
"password": "password",
----

* Launch the Sync Gateway.
+
*macOS*
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd /path/to/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin
$ ./sync_gateway /path/to/mobile-travel-sample/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json
----
*Windows*
+
By default, the Sync Gateway service will install with _serviceconfig.json_ as the configuration file at *C:\Program%20Files\Couchbase\Sync%20Gateway\serviceconfig.json*.
+
The Sync Gateway will have to be launched with the config file named `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` that you should have downloaded as per the instructions in the <<Workshop Repo>> section.
The config file will be located in ``C:/path/to/mobile-travel-sample``.
+
Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json and confirm that the RBAC user credentials configured on the Couchbase Server are used by Sync Gateway for accessing the bucket.
+
[source,json]
----
"username": "admin",
"password": "password",
----
+
* Stop the Sync Gateway service (since it would be launched with the default version of config file).
To stop the service, you can use the Services application (Control Panel --> Admin Tools --> Services).
* Replace the _serviceconfig.json_ file with the `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json`
+
[source,bash]
----
copy c:/path/to/mobile-travel-sample/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json "C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\serviceconfig.json"
----
* Start the Sync Gateway service with the new version of _serviceconfig.json_ file.
To start the service, you can use the Services application (Control Panel --> Admin Tools --> Services).
