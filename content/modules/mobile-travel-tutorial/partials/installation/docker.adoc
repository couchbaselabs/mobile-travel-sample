[source,bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
docker pull couchbase/server-sandbox:{cbs-version}
----

* Once the command has completed you can start the application with the following.
+
[source,bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
docker run -d --name cb-server --network workshop -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 couchbase/server-sandbox:{cbs-version}
----

* You can view the logs at any time by running the following command.
+
[source,bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
docker logs cb-server
----

* It may take a few seconds for the server to startup.
Verify that the docker image is running with following command.

that you should have downloaded as part of the <<repository,Workshop Repo>> step.
The config file is located in the root folder of `/path/to/mobile-travel-sample`.

* Open the `sync-gateway-config-travelsample-docker.json` file using any text editor of choice

* For the app to connect to the Couchbase Server, the address of the the server needs to be specified.
Note that when you launched the Couchbase Server docker container, you gave it the `name` of "cb-server".
