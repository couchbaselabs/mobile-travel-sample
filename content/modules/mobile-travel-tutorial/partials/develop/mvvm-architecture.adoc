= MVVM Architecture

== Overview

=== The Model-View-ViewModel pattern

In our app, we follow the MVVM pattern, which decouples the retrieval of data, view logic, and presentation into three distinct areas.

==== Model

The model provides and stores the internal data.
In our travel app, for simplicity, we use standard data types of `Dictionary` and `Array` to represent the data.
In a real application, one would use a custom object to represent the model. 

The app implements the following models - _Booking_ which represents a flight reservation - _Flight_ which represents airline details - _Airport_ which represents airport name - _Hotel_ which represents hotel details 

In addition, the `CouchbaseSession` class is used to keep state through multiple pages. 

==== View

In the Travel app, the `ContentPage` class represents the "view" in MVVM.
It handles user input and forwards requests to the VIew Model.
It updates the UI based on response from the View Model. 

The app implements the following Views - _LoginPage_ which represents the login UI - _BookmarkedHotelsPage_ which represents the UI that lists bookmarked hotels - _FlightBookingsPage_ which represents the flight reservations UI - _HotelsListPage_ which represents the UI that lists hotels - _HotelDetailsPage_ which represents the UI that lists hotel details 

==== View Model

The View Model acts as the intermediary between the View and the Model.
It is responsible for interacting with the model and updating it's state to indicate how the view should present itself.
There is one view model per view and is named according to the view 

* _LoginViewModel_
* _BookmarkedHotelsViewModel_
* _FlightBookingsViewModel_
* _HotelsListViewModel_
* _HotelDetailsViewModel_
