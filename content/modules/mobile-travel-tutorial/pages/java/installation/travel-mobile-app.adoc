== Pre-requisites
While you can use any IDE of your choice suited for Java development, in this tutorial we will be working with *IntelliJ IDEA*. All instructions in the workshop assume this IDE.

* IntelliJ IDEA 2019 or above downloadable from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac[Jetbrains Developer site]. The *Community* version is sufficient for our purposes.
* JDK 8

*Windows Users* : If you are developing on Windows, you must use a Windows 10 machine.
Also, note that if you choose the Manual or Docker installation mode, you should also have *administrative privileges on the Windows box* so you can authorize the installation and running of the required executables.

== Travel Sample Mobile App

* Clone the "master" branch of the Travel Sample app from GitHub. We are doing a shallow pull with `depth` as 1 to speed the cloning process. 
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone -b master --depth 1 https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample.git
----
* Open *java/TravelSample/build.gradle* using IntelliJ IDEA.


== Configure App to connect to Backend
You will have to update the URLs specified in the app to connect to the backend
If you haven't done so already, complete the steps outlined in the "Backend Installation" to install your Couchbase Server, Sync Gateway and Python web backend app.

=== Updating the web backend URL

*Open the file* `TryCb.java` in net folder.
You must update the `WEB_APP_ENDPOINT` constant which points to the Python Web Server.

Now, the URLs that you specify will vary depending on the installation option that you chose for deploying your backend

// Replace the hostname with the IP Address of the RightScale instance.
// The example states `54.148.83.39` but yours will be different.
 public static final String WEB_APP_ENDPOINT = "http://54.148.83.39:8080/api/";

=== Updating the Sync Gateway URL

Next, you will update the Sync Gateway endpoint.

*Open the file* `ReplicatorManager.java` in db folder
You must update the `SGW_ENDPOINT` constant.

Now, the URLs that you specify will vary depending on the installation option that you chose for deploying your backend
