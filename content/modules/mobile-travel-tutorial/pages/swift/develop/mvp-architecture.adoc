= MVP Architecture

== Overview

=== The Model-View-Presenter pattern

In our app, we follow the MVP pattern, separating the internal data model, from a passive view through a presenter that handles the logic of our application and acts as the conduit between the model and the view.

==== Protocols

In the Travel app, we define two sets of protocols.
The `PresenterProtocol` protocol that must be implemented by all Presenter objects and `PresentingViewProtocol` must be implemented by the corresponding "view" objects.
The `PresenterProtocol` and `PresentingViewProtocol` may be optionally extended to support capabilities of specific presenter/view 

The app defines the following PresenterProtocols that extend the `PresenterProtocol` protocol.

* _BookingPresenterProtocol_ defines methods to be implemented by the Booking Presenter.
* _FlightPresenterProtocol_ defines methods to be implemented by the Flight Presenter.
* _AirportPresenterProtocol_ defines methods to be implemented by the Airport Presenter.
* _HotelPresenterProtocol_ defines methods to be implemented by the Hotel Presenter.

The app defines the following PresentingViewProtocols that extend the `PresentingViewProtocol` protocol.

* _BookingPresentingViewProtocol_ defines methods to be implemented by the Booking View

==== Model

The model provides and stores the internal data.
In our travel app, for simplicity, we use standard data types of `Dictionary` and `Array` to represent the data.
In a real application, one would use a custom object to represent the model. 

The app implements the following models.

- _Booking_ which represents a flight reservation
- _Flight_ which represents airline details
- _Airport_ which represents airport name
- _Hotel_ which represents hotel details

In addition, the `DatabaseManager.swift` is a singleton class that is used to manage the common database operations such as Database Creation/Deletion and Replication. 

==== View

In the Travel app, the `UIView` and the `UIViewController` classes represent the "view" in MVP.
It handles user input and forwards requests to the Presenter.
It updates the UI based on response from the Presenter.
The view object holds a weak reference to the corresponding Presenter object that implements the corresponding ``PresenterProtocol``. 

The app implements the following ViewControllers.

- _LoginViewController_ which represents the login UI
- _BookmarkedHotelsTableViewController_ which represents the UI that lists bookmarked hotels
- _BookingTableViewController_ which represents the flight reservations UI
- _FlightListingTableViewController_ which represents the UI that lists of flight details
- _FlightSearchViewController_ which represents flight search UI
- _HotelsTableViewController_ which represents the UI that lists hotels
- _HotelDetailViewController_ which represents the UI that lists hotel details

In addition, there are custom UITableViewCells.

==== Presenter

The Presenter acts as the intermediary between the View and the Model.
It holds a weak reference to the corresponding view object that implements appropriate `PresentingViewProtocol`.

The app implements the following Presenters.

- _BookingPresenter_ which implements the `BookingPresenterProtocol`
- _FlightPresenter_ which implements the `FlightPresenterProtocol`
- _AirportPresenter_ which implements the `AirportPresenterProtocol`
- _HotelPresenter_ which implements the `HotelPresenterProtocol`

In addition, there are some simple custom UI widgets like custom UITableViewCells
