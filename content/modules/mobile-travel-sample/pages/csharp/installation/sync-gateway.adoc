= Sync Gateway 2.1

== Manual

In this lesson, you will install and launch version 2.1 of the Sync Gateway 

*If you would prefer to use a docker
    container instead, please proceed to the http://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/csharp/#/0/3/1[docker]
    section*

* Install Sync Gateway 2.1 following the instructions specified https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.1/installation/sync-gateway/index.html[here]. Make sure you select "Windows" from the list of platform tabs to install on. 
* By default, the Sync Gateway service will install with _serviceconfig.json_ config file at this link:C:\Program%20Files\Couchbase\Sync%20Gateway\serviceconfig.json[location]
* The Sync Gateway will have to be launched with the config file named `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` that you should have downloaded as part of the link:/develop/csharp#/0/1/0[Travel Mobile App install]. The config file will be located in ``c:/path/to/mobile-travel-sample``. 
* Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json and confirm that the RBAC user credentials configured on the Couchbase Server are used by Sync Gateway for accessing the bucket

* Stop the Sync Gateway service (since it was launched with the default version of config file). To stop the service, you can use the Services application (Control Panel --> Admin Tools --> Services). 
* Replace the _serviceconfig.json_ file located at C:FilesGatewayÂ with the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json that you downloaded.

[source,bash]
----

$ copy c:/path/to/mobile-travel-sample/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json "C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\serviceconfig.json"
----
* Start the Sync Gateway service with the new version of _serviceconfig.json_ file. To start the service, you can use the Services application (Control Panel --> Admin Tools --> Services).

== Docker (Local)

_NOTE_ : If you are running the Sync Gateway in a docker container, please make sure that you have the Couchbase Server running in a container as well.
If not, please follow instructions link:/develop/csharp#/0/2/1[here] to install the server container. 

* Create a local docker network named "workshop" if one does not exist already. Open a terminal window and run the following command `bash   $ docker network ls   $ docker network create -d bridge workshop`
* To run the application in a container, you will first get the docker image from Docker Cloud. `bash   $ docker pull connectsv/sync-gateway:2.1.0-enterprise`
* The Sync Gateway will be launched with the config file named `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` that you should have downloaded as part of the link:/develop/csharp#/0/1/0[Travel Mobile App install]. The config file is located in ``/path/to/mobile-travel-sample``. 
* Open the `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` file 
* For the app to connect to the Couchbase Server, the address of the the server needs to be specified. Note that when you launched the Couchbase Server docker container, you gave it the `name` of "cb-server". Replace the `localhost` in the file with `cb-server` and save 

`json    "server": "http://cb-server:8091"`

* Launch the Sync Gateway with the `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` file. Once the command has completed you can start the application with the following. 

```bash $ cd /path/to/mobile-travel-sample/ 

$ docker run -p 4984-4985:4984-4985 --network workshop --name sync-gateway -d -v %cd%/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json:/etc/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json connectsv/sync-gateway:2.1.0-enterprise -adminInterface :4985 /etc/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json ``` The first time you run this on Windows, you may see an alert pop up asking for permissions to share drive.
Make sure you select "Share it" and proceed.
You would need administrator privileges for this image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/docker_windows.png[]

* You can view the logs at any time by running the following command `bash   $ docker logs sync-gateway`
* Verify that the docker container named "sync-gateway" is running with the following command in the terminal window `bash   $ docker ps`

== Cloud

*NOTE:* The RightScale cloud environment is only available for in-classroom run workshops. 

If you chose Cloud in the <<_/0/2/2,previous
    step>> then all the components (Sync Gateway, Couchbase Server and the Python Web App) are already installed and running.
You can move on to the <<_/1/0/0,next chapter>> to learn about the data modeling requirements of the app.
