== Sync Gateway

In this section, you will install and launch version 2.1 of Sync Gateway.

* Install Sync Gateway 2.1 from https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[here] on your platform of choice
* The Sync Gateway will have to be launched with the config file named `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` that you should have downloaded as part of the link:/develop/swift#/0/1/0[Travel Mobile App install]. The config file will be located in ``/path/to/mobile-travel-sample``.
* Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json and confirm that the RBAC user credentials configured on the Couchbase Server are used by Sync Gateway for accessing the bucket
+
[source,json]
----
"username": "admin",
"password": "password",
----
* Launch the Sync Gateway.
+
*macOS*
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd /path/to/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin
$ ./sync_gateway /path/to/mobile-travel-sample/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json
----
*Windows*
+
By default, the Sync Gateway service will install with _serviceconfig.json_ as the configuration file at *C:\Program%20Files\Couchbase\Sync%20Gateway\serviceconfig.json*.
+
The Sync Gateway will have to be launched with the config file named `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` that you should have downloaded as part of the link:/develop/csharp#/0/1/0[Travel Mobile App
    install].
The config file will be located in ``C:/path/to/mobile-travel-sample``.
+
Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json and confirm that the RBAC user credentials configured on the Couchbase Server are used by Sync Gateway for accessing the bucket.
+
[source,json]
----
"username": "admin",
"password": "password",
----
+
* Stop the Sync Gateway service (since it was launched with the default version of config file). To stop the service, you can use the Services application (Control Panel --> Admin Tools --> Services).
* Replace the _serviceconfig.json_ file located at C:FilesGatewayÂ with the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json that you downloaded.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ copy c:/path/to/mobile-travel-sample/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json "C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\serviceconfig.json"
----
* Start the Sync Gateway service with the new version of _serviceconfig.json_ file. To start the service, you can use the Services application (Control Panel --> Admin Tools --> Services).

*Try it out*

* Access this URL `http://localhost:4984` in your browser
* Verify that you get JSON response similar to one below `json   {"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":"2.1"},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/2.1.0(775;9cc29c5)"}`

== Python Backend
