We will use the Python version of the https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/sdk/python/sample-app-backend.html[Travel
  Sample Web Backend] which uses the Couchbase Python SDK to with with Couchbase Server Query Services. 

*If you would prefer to use a docker container
  instead, please proceed to the http://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/swift/#/0/4/1[docker]
  section*

* *PREREQUISITE* : First, install *libcouchbase* Core C SDK used by the Python SDK 
* Follow instructions https://developer.couchbase.com/server/other-products/release-notes-archives/c-sdk[here] to install libcouchbase on your platform of choice 
* Clone the 5.0 branch of Travel Sample web app repo 
+

[source,bash]
----

$ git clone -b 5.0 https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-python.git
----
* We will run the Travel Web App in a Python https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/[virtual environment]. First, check if `virtualenv` is installed on your system 
+

[source,bash]
----

$ virtualenv --version
----
* if `virtualenv` is not installed , you can use `apt-get` or `pip` to install it 
+

[source,bash]
----

$ sudo pip install virtualenv
----
* Specify the folder for your virtual environment 
+

[source,bash]
----

$ virtualenv /path/to/try-cb-python
----
* Activate your environment. You should see a prompt as shown below 
+

[source,bash]
----

$ source /path/to/try-cb-python/bin/activate
$ (try-cb-python) Macintosh-2:try-cb-python mactester$
----
* The application uses several Python libraries that need to be installed, this are listed in requirements.txt and can be automatically loaded using the pip command 
+

[source,bash]
----

cd /path/to/try-cb-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
----
* Update the travel.py file to reflect the username and password that you have used during Couchbase Server install. This defaults to "Administrator" and "password" 
+

[source,python]
----

DEFAULT_USER = "Administrator"
PASSWORD = 'password'
----
* Now launch the Travel Web App 
+

[source,bash]
----

$ python travel.py
$ Running on http://localhost:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
----


[[_try_it_out]]
== Try it out

* Open http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser 
* Verify that you see the login screen of the Travel Sample Web App as shown below image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/try_cb_login.png[]
= 

_NOTE_ : If you are running the Web App in a docker container, please make sure that you have the Couchbase Server and Sync Gateway running in containers as well.
If not, please follow instructions link:/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/swift#/0/2/1[here] to install the server container and link:/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/swift#/0/3/1[here] to install sync gateway container. 

* Create a local docker network named "workshop" if one does not exist already. Open a terminal window and run the following command `bash   $ docker network ls   $ docker network create -d bridge workshop`
* To run the application in a container, you will first get the docker image from Docker Cloud. Open a terminal window and run the following. 

`bash   $ docker pull connectsv/try-cb-python:5.5.1-server`

* Once the command has completed you can start the application with the following. 

`bash   $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --network workshop connectsv/try-cb-python:5.5.1-server`

You should then see the following in the console output. 

`bash   Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)` ## Try it out - Open http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser - Verify that you see the login screen of the Travel Sample Web App as shown below image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/try_cb_login.png[]= 

*NOTE:* The RightScale cloud environment is only available for in-classroom run workshops. 

If you chose Cloud in the <<_/0/2/2,previous step>> then all the components (Sync Gateway, Couchbase Server and the Python Web App) are already installed and running.
You can move on to the <<_/1/0/0,next chapter>> to learn about the data modeling requirements of the app.
