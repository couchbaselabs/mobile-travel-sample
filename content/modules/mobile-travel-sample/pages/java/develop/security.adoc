== User Management

User is created via the Travel sample web app.
When a user is created, a corresponding user profile document is created on Couchbase Server.

=== Try it out (Web App)

* Access the Travel Web App URL in the browser. This URL would be http://localhost:8080 if you installed the web app manually or via docker container. If you used the Cloud install, please access the cloud instance of the web app. 
* Create a new user by entering "demo" as the username and "password" for the password. Make sure the "create new user" checkbox is selected. 
* You should be logged into the web app. There should be nothing created for the user.

=== Try it out (Couchbase Server)

* Access the Couchbase Server URL in the browser. This URL would be http://localhost:8091 if you installed the server manually or via docker container. If you used the Cloud install, please access the cloud instance of the server. 
* Log in with Administrator credentials that you set up during the installation of Couchbase Server. 
* In the search box, enter "user::demo". 
* You should see the user document that was created when you signed up via the web app. 
* Confirm that the "username" that you see is "demo"

== Access Control

In this lesson you'll be introduced to Sync Gateway, our secure web gateway.

The Couchbase Sync Gateway is an Internet-facing synchronization mechanism that exposes a web interface which provides:

- Data Synchronization and Routing
- Authorization
- Access Control

In this chapter, we will focus on Authorization and Access Control.
We will discuss Data Synchronization and Routing in the xref::java/develop/sync.adoc[Sync] lesson.

In the xref::java/installation/overview.adoc[Installation] guide, we walked you through the steps to launch Sync Gateway with a specific config file.
The Sync Gateway configuration file determines the runtime behavior of Sync Gateway. 

Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json file located at https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json. 

The `users` section defines the hardcoded list of users who are granted access. It includes the "demo" user that we created via the Travel Web App in the "User Management" section. A "tester" and "admin" user is also configured. Note that in a real world app, when a user registers via the web app, the web app would use the Sync Gateway REST API to dynamically create the user.

[source,javascript]
----
"users": {
  "admin": {"password": "password", "admin_channels": ["*"]},
  "demo": {"password": "password"},
  "tester": {"password": "password"}
}
----

The Sync Function in the config file is a JavaScript function which implements the access control logic. The `access` method is used to grant the current user access to specific channel. We will discuss channels in detail in the link:/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/swift#/2/3/0["Sync"] section. For now, it is sufficient to note that documents are associated with channel(s). So access to a document is controlled by controlling the access rights to a channel.


[source,javascript]
----
  // Give user read access to channel
  if (!isDelete()) {
  // Deletion of user document is essentially deletion of user
  access(username,"channel." + username)
}
----

=== Try it out

* Run the following command in your terminal. If you did a cloud based install, please replace `localhost` in the command below with the IP Address of the cloud instance of the Sync Gateway. 
+

[source,bash]
----

curl -X GET http://localhost:4984/travel-sample/
----
* Confirm that you see an "Unauthorized" error from the server 
* Run the following command in yout terminal. The `authorization` header is base64 encoded value of "demo:password". If you did a cloud based install, please replace `localhost` in the command below with the IP Address of the cloud instance of the Sync Gateway. 
+

[source,bash]
----

curl -X GET http://localhost:4984/travel-sample/ -H 'authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwYXNzd29yZA=='
----
* Confirm that you see the details of the "travel-sample" database and "state" is "online"
