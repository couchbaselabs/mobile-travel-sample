== Create a Database

There is no limit to how many databases can be created or opened on the device.
You can think of a database as a namespace for documents and several databases can be used in the same app (one database per user of the app is a common pattern). 

The snippet below creates an empty database for the `guest` user in a directory named ``guest``. 

*Open the file* `DatabaseManager.java`.
We will review the `DatabaseManager(Context context, boolean isGuest)` constructor method.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/util/DatabaseManager.java#L38[DatabaseManager.java]

[source,java]
----
protected DatabaseManager(Context context, boolean isGuest) {
  ...
}
----

We create a folder for the `guest` user database if one does not exist and specify that as the database `directory` in the `DatabaseConfiguration` object.

[source,java]
----
if (isGuest) {
    DatabaseConfiguration config = new DatabaseConfiguration(context);
    config.setDirectory(String.format("%s/guest", context.getFilesDir()));
----

The Couchbase Lite Database is created with specified name and `DatabaseConfiguration` object.

[source,java]
----
  try {
    database = new Database("travel-sample", config);
  } catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
} else {
       ...
}
----

=== Try it out

* Build and Run the Travel Sample Mobile App 
* On the Login screen select "`Proceed as Guest`" option.
* This will log you into the app in Guest Mode. Signing in as Guest will create a new empty database for "`guest`" account if one does not exist
* Confirm that you see the "Bookmarked Hotels" page. It will be empty the very first time.

== Create and Update a Document

Bookmarked hotels are persisted in a separate document with a `type` of ``bookmarkedhotels``.

The first time a hotel is bookmarked, the `bookmarkedhotels` document is created with the document ID of that hotel document in the `hotels` property.
The hotel's information is persisted in a separate `hotels` type document. 

Subsequently, every time a hotel is bookmarked, the process repeats.

[source,json]
----
{
  "_id": "hotel1",
  "name": "San Francisco Hotel",
  "address": "123, Park Street, San Francisco"
}

{
  "type": "bookmarkedhotels",
  "hotels": ["hotel1", "hotel2"]
}
----

*Open the file* `app/src/android/java/.../hotels/HotelsPresenter.java`.
You will review the `bookmarkHotels(Map<String, Object> hotel)` method.
Remove the `return;` statement. 

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/hotels/HotelsPresenter.java#L110[HotelsPresenter.java]

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void bookmarkHotels(Map<String, Object> hotel) {
  ...
}
----

First, you need to get an instance of the database. 

[source,java]
----

Database database = DatabaseManager.getDatabase();
----

The following snippet persists the hotel instance (``Map<String, Object>``) as a new `Document` in the database.
This will allow us to access bookmarked hotel documents while being offline. 

[source,java]
----

MutableDocument hotelDoc = new MutableDocument((String) hotel.get("id"), hotel);
try {
  database.save(hotelDoc);
} catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
}
----

Now you will get the document with ID `user::guest` or create one if it doesn't exist.
The document is created with the `type` property set to `bookmarkedhotels` and a new `hotels` array to store the document IDs of the bookmarked hotels. 

[source]
----
/* 2. Look-up Guest user document. */
Document document = database.getDocument("user::guest");
MutableDocument mutableCopy = null;
if (document == null) {
	HashMap<String,Object> properties = new HashMap();
	properties.put(type, bookmarkedhotels);
	properties.put(hotels, new ArrayList());
	mutableCopy = new MutableDocument(user::guest, properties);
} else {
	mutableCopy = document.toMutable();
}
----

Next, the selected hotel's ID is added to the `hotels` array. 

[source,java]
----
MutableArray hotels =  mutableCopy.getArray(hotels).toMutable();
mutableCopy.setArray(hotels,hotels.addString((String) hotel.get(id)));
----

Finally, you will save the document. 

[source,java]
----

try {
  database.save(mutableCopy);
} catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
}
----

=== Try it out

* As Guest User, tap on "`hotels`" button 
* In location text field , enter London 
* You will see list of hotels. 
* The list of hotels is pulled from the Couchbase Server via the Travel Sample Web Services API. The list of hotels is not displayed unless there is an open connection the python web app so make sure you have your Travel Sample Web app running 
* Tap on the first hotel cell to bookmark it 
* Verify that you see the bookmarked hotel in the "`Bookmarked Hotels`" screen. A motivation for having separate docs for each bookmarked hotel is if they become sharable between users via the sync function.

== Delete a Document

A document can be deleted using the `delete` method.
This operation actually creates a new `tombstoned` revision in order to propagate the deletion to other clients. 

*Open the file* in ``app/src/android/java/.../bookmarks/BookmarksPresenter.java``.
You will review the `removeBookmark(Map<String, Object> bookmark)` method. 

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/bookmarks/BookmarksPresenter.java#L77[BookmarksPresenter]

[source,java]
----

@Override
public void removeBookmark(Map<String, Object> bookmark) {
    ...
}
----

When searching for hotels in **Guest
    mode**, the app sends a GET request to the Python Web App which performs a Full-Text Search query on Couchbase Server.
Then, if a hotel is bookmarked, it gets inserted in the Couchbase Lite database for offline access.
So when the user unbookmarks a hotel, the document needs to be removed from the database.
That's what the code below is doing. 

[source,java]
----

Database database = DatabaseManager.getDatabase();
Document document = database.getDocument((String) bookmark.get("id"));
try {
  database.delete(document);
} catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
}
----

In addition to deleting the document of type "hotel" as shown above, the unbookmarking process removes the hotel ID from the `hotels` array in the "bookmarkedhotels" document. 

=== Try it out

* Swipe left on first Hotel cell to unbookmark/remove the cell
* Verify that you see a single hotel in the list
