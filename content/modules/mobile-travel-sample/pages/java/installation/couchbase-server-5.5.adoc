*Try it out*

* Launch Couchbase Server (if not already runnning)
* Log into the "Admin Console" with appropriate Administrator credentials you created during installation
* Select the "Buckets" option from the menu on the left
* Verify that you have around 31,000 documents in your travel-sample bucket
--

Docker::
+
--
* Create a local docker network named "workshop" if one does not exist already. Open a terminal window and run the following command `bash   $ docker network ls   $ docker network create -d bridge workshop`
* To run the application in a container, you will first get the docker image from Docker Hub. Open a new terminal window and run the following. `bash   $ docker pull connectsv/server:5.5.1-enterprise`
* Once the command has completed you can start the application with the following.

`bash   $ docker run -d --name cb-server --network workshop -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 connectsv/server:5.5.1-enterprise`

* You can view the logs at any time by running the following command `bash   $ docker logs cb-server`
* It may take a few seconds for the server to startup. Verify that the docker image is running with following command `bash   $ docker ps`


=== Try it out

* Launch Couchbase Server
* Log into the "Admin Console" with username as "Administrator" and password as "password"
* Select the "Buckets" option from the menu on the left
* Verify that you have around 31,000 documents in your travel-sample bucket

Cloud::

--
*NOTE:* The RightScale cloud environment is only available for in-classroom run workshops.

Before you get started with this section, make sure your followed the instructions link:/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java#/0/1/0[here] to download the Travel Mobile app.
Use this option to connect to a private instance of Couchbase Server components running on Rightscale cloud environment.
At the end of this lesson, the following components will be launched in the cloud- - Couchbase Server - Sync Gateway - Travel Web Application

NOTE: This instance will be available for you to use for the duration of the workshop.
The instance will automatically be terminated after the workshop.
Every user will have their own sandboxed instance.

* Access https://selfservice-4.rightscale.com/catalog on your browser.
* Log in with `workshop@couchbase.com` and `cbworkshop123` as the password. image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_login.png[]
* From the catalog of available projects, select the **Mobile Workshop 2017**, give it a name and then click **Launch**. image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_selectproject.png[]
* Once the instance is running, You should see the state change to "launching". It will take several minutes to launch. So be patient! image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_launching.png[]
* Once the instance is running, You should see the state change to "running". There are two instances - one for "Develop" and one for "Deploy". We are only interested in the "Develop" option. image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_running.png[]

Now that you have the instance up and running, you will have to edit the mobile app so it points to the newly deployed Python Web Server and Sync Gateway.

*Open the file* ``DatabaseManager.java``.
You must update the `mPythonWebServerEndpoint` constant which points to the Python Web Server.
Replace the hostname with the IP Address of the Rightscale instance.
In the example above that would be `54.148.83.39` but yours will be different.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/util/DatabaseManager.java[DatabaseManager.java]

[source,java]
----
public static String mPythonWebServerEndpoint = "http://54.148.83.39:8080/api/";
----

Next, you will update the Sync Gateway endpoint.

*Open the file*``DatabaseManager.java``.
You must update the `mSyncGatewayEndpoint` constant.
Replace the hostname with the IP Address of the Rightscale instance.
In the example above that would be `54.148.83.39` but yours will be different.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/util/DatabaseManager.java[DatabaseManager.java]

[source,java]
----
public static String mSyncGatewayEndpoint = "ws://54.148.83.39:4984/travel-sample";
----

=== Try it out (Couchbase Server)

* Access Couchbase Server from the URL listed in the Deploy instance. In my example (from screenshot above), that would be `http://54.148.83.39:8091`
* Log into the "Admin Console" with username as "Administrator" and password as "password"
* Select the "Buckets" option from the menu on the left
* Verify that you have around 31,000 documents in your travel-sample bucket


=== Try it out (Sync Gateway)

* Access Sync Gateway from the URL listed in the Deploy instance. In my example (from screenshot above), that would be `http://52.38.236.38:4984`
* You should the following response `json  {   "couchdb":"Welcome",   "vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":2.1},   "version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/2.1(...)"  }`


=== Try it out (Travel App)

* Access Travel Web App from the URL listed in the Deploy instance. In my example (from screenshot above), that would be `http://54.148.83.39:8080`
* Verify that you see the login screen of the Travel Sample Web App as shown below image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/try_cb_login.png[]
