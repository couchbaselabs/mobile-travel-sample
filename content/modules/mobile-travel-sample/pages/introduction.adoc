= Introduction

== Application Features

We will do a code walkthrough of a sample Travel application for mobile platforms using Couchbase Mobile 2.1.
The simple app will allow users to search for and to make flight reservations.
Users will also be able to search for hotels based on specific criteria.
The mobile app will use the Couchbase Lite 2.0 API that includes support for a N1QL like query interface and Full Text Search (FTS) capabilities.
The app will sync documents with Sync Gateway 2.1 using a new websockets based replication protocol.
Additionally, we will use a web version of the Travel Sample app which includes the ability to make flight reservations.
Documents are persisted on Couchbase Server and seamlessly synced over to web and mobile clients.
