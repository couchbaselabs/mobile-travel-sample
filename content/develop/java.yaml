              This is the high level architecture of the system that we will be running
              ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/travelsampleapp-arch.png)

              It includes the following components -
              - Client Side 
                - Travel Mobile App -  Android App in java that is linked with Couchbase Lite Enterprise 2.1 
              - Server Side
                - Couchbase Server Enterprise v5.5
                - Sync Gateway Enterprise v2.1 
                - Travel Web App - Python web app integrated with Couchbase Python SDK

              **For the server side components, you have three installation options** 

              **NOTE** : Make sure you use the same installation option for _all_ server components. i.e. if you selected Docker (Local), then you must use docker for all of them and so on.

              - **Manual**: Here, you would download and install the components on your local machine.
              - **Docker (Local)**: In this case, you would install all the server components in separate docker containers on your local machine.
              - **Cloud (Rightscale)**: In this case, you can launch and connect to an instance of the server components running on a cloud instance.

          - title: Pre-requisites
            description: |
              To start, it is easiest if you run all the components on the same machine. It's not required to run your development environment this way but it is more convenient to start a development environment with components running locally.  
 
              **Windows Users** : 
              - If you are developing on Windows, we recommend that you use a Windows 10 machine. 
                Also, note that if you choose Manual or docker installation mode, you should also have **administrative privileges on the Windows box** so you can authorize the installation and running of the required executables. 

              #### Android
              - Android Studio 2.3.3 or above [Google Developer site](https://developer.android.com)

              - Android SDK 26
              - Android Build Tools 26
              - JDK 8
            
              #### Visual C++ 2017 (Only Windows Users)
              You need this only if you use the "Manual" installation option
              - **Windows Users** must install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python Downloadable from [downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266)

              #### Python (v2.7 and above)
              You need this only if you use the "Manual" installation option
              - Downloadable from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
              - **Windows Users** : If you are developing on Windows, make sure that Python is included in your system's PATH environment variable. You can follow instructions [here](https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/) to set your PATH variable. 

              #### Docker
              You need this only if you use the "Docker" installation option
              - **Windows Users** : If you are developing on Windows, you may need to install Docker as Admin user 
              - Downloadable from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-docker). Community edition would suffice.
              
              #### git
              - Create a [free github account](https://github.com) if you don't already have one
              - git can be downloaded from [git-scm.org](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

          - title: Manual
            description: |
              In this lesson, you will install and launch version 5.5 of the Couchbase Server.

              **If you would prefer to use a docker container instead, please proceed to the [docker](http://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java/#/0/2/1) section**

              - [Download and install](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads#couchbase-server) V5.5.1 of Couchbase Server. Follow the instructions specified in the appropriate platform specific [install guide](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.5/install/install-intro.html) to install the same. 
               - **Windows Users** You would need suitable admin level privileges to be able to authorize the install of  Couchbase Server on your machine. The anti-virus software on your machine may prohibit the automatic installation of the service

              - In setup wizard, create Administrator account with user *Administrator* and password as *password*.
                ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/createadminuser.png)
    
              - As you follow the download instructions and setup wizard, make sure you keep all the services (data, query, and index) selected.
              
                ![](https://cl.ly/1o3H0t3f0d1n/cbs-services.png)
              
              - Install the sample bucket named *travel-sample* because it contains the data used in this tutorial. You can add the bucket from the "Sample Buckets" tab in the "Settings" menu in the admin console 
        
                ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/sample_bucket.png)
        
              - Create an RBAC user named **admin** with password **password** and **Application Access** to the travel-sample bucket. You can do this from the "Security" menu. These credentials will be used by the Sync Gateway to access the documents in this bucket.
                ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/add_rbac.png)

                ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/RBAC_user.png)
        
              - Create a Full text search index on travel-sample bucket called 'hotels'. You can do this from the "Search" menu. Just go with default index settings.

              ## Try it out
              
              - Launch Couchbase Server (if not already runnning)
              - Log into the "Admin Console" (`http://localhost:8091`) with appropriate Administrator credentials you created during installation
              - Select the "Buckets" option from the menu on the left
              - Verify that you have around 31,000 documents in your travel-sample bucket       
           
          - title: Docker (Local)
            description: |
              - Create a local docker network named "workshop" if one does not exist already. Open a terminal window and run the following command
                ```bash
                $ docker network ls
                $ docker network create -d bridge workshop
                ```
              - To run the application in a container, you will first get the docker image from Docker Hub. Open a new terminal window and run the following.
                ```bash
                $ docker pull connectsv/server:5.5.1-enterprise
                ```
              
              - Once the command has completed you can start the application with the following.
              
                ```bash
                $ docker run -d --name cb-server --network workshop -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 connectsv/server:5.5.1-enterprise
                ```
              - You can view the logs at any time by running the following command
                ```bash
                $ docker logs cb-server
                ```
              - It may take a few seconds for the server to startup. Verify that the docker image is running with following command
                ```bash
                $ docker ps
                ```
        
              ### Try it out
              
              - Launch Couchbase Server 
              - Log into the "Admin Console" with username as "Administrator" and password as "password"
              - Select the "Buckets" option from the menu on the left
              - Verify that you have around 31,000 documents in your travel-sample bucket

          - title: Cloud
            description: |
              **NOTE:** The RightScale cloud environment is only available for in-classroom run workshops. 
              
              Before you get started with this section, make sure your followed the instructions [here](/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java#/0/1/0) to download the Travel Mobile app.
              Use this option to connect to a private instance of Couchbase Server components running on Rightscale cloud environment. At the end of this lesson, the following components will be launched in the cloud-
              - Couchbase Server
              - Sync Gateway
              - Travel Web Application 
            
              NOTE: This instance will be available for you to use for the duration of the workshop. The instance will automatically be terminated after the workshop. Every user will have their own sandboxed instance.
            

              - Access [https://selfservice-4.rightscale.com/catalog](https://selfservice-4.rightscale.com/catalog) on your browser.
              - Log in with `workshop@couchbase.com` and `cbworkshop123` as the password.
              ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_login.png)
              - From the catalog of available projects, select the **Mobile Workshop 2017**, give it a name and then click **Launch**. 
              ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_selectproject.png)
              - Once the instance is running, You should see the state change to "launching". It will take several minutes to launch. So be patient!
              ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_launching.png)
              - Once the instance is running, You should see the state change to "running". There are two instances - one for "Develop" and  one for "Deploy". We are only interested in the "Develop" option.
              ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_running.png)
              
              Now that you have the instance up and running, you will have to edit the mobile app so it points to the newly deployed Python Web Server and Sync Gateway.
              
              **Open the file** `DatabaseManager.java`. You must update the `mPythonWebServerEndpoint` constant which points to the Python Web Server. Replace the hostname with the IP Address of the Rightscale instance. In the example above that would be `54.148.83.39` but yours will be different.
              
              [DatabaseManager.java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/util/DatabaseManager.java)

              ```java
              public static String mPythonWebServerEndpoint = "http://54.148.83.39:8080/api/";
              ```
              
              Next, you will update the Sync Gateway endpoint.
              
              **Open the file** `DatabaseManager.java`. You must update the `mSyncGatewayEndpoint` constant. Replace the hostname with the IP Address of the Rightscale instance. In the example above that would be `54.148.83.39` but yours will be different.
              
              [DatabaseManager.java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/util/DatabaseManager.java)

              ```java
              public static String mSyncGatewayEndpoint = "ws://54.148.83.39:4984/travel-sample";
              ```
               
              ## Try it out (Couchbase Server)
              - Access Couchbase Server from the URL listed in the Deploy instance. In my example (from screenshot above), that would be `http://54.148.83.39:8091`
              - Log into the "Admin Console" with username as "Administrator" and password as "password"
              - Select the "Buckets" option from the menu on the left
              - Verify that you have around 31,000 documents in your travel-sample bucket
              
              ## Try it out (Sync Gateway)
              - Access Sync Gateway from the URL listed in the Deploy instance. In my example (from screenshot above), that would be `http://52.38.236.38:4984`

               ```json
               {
                "couchdb":"Welcome",
                "vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":2.1},
                "version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/2.1(...)"
               }
               ```
            
              ## Try it out (Travel App)

          # - title: Docker Compose
          #   description: |
          #     Alternatively, you can use Docker compose to install all of the three server side components 
          #       - The Travel Sample Web App
          #       - Couchbase Server 5.0 
          #       - Sync Gateway 1.5.


          #     - Locate the `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` file at the root of the Travel Sample Mobile App Github repo that you cloned as per the instructions in the [Travel Sample Mobile Install](http://docs-build.sc.couchbase.com:9000/java#/0/0/1) guide. For the app to connect to the Couchbase Server, the  IP Address of the the server needs to be specified. Since the Couchbase Server is running locally on your machine, this would be the local IP Address of your machine.
          #       -  Identify the local IP Address of your machine. On a Linux or macOS system, type in the following command in terminal
          #         ``` bash
          #         $ ifconfig
          #         ```
          #       - Open the `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` and look for `server`and update `localhost` with the local IP Address of your machine. In this example, the local IP Address is `192.168.1.121`
          #         ``` JavaScript
          #         "server": "http://192.168.1.121:8091"
          #         ```

          #     - Locate the `docker-componse.yml` file at the root of the Travel Sample Mobile App Github repo that you cloned as per the instructions in the [Travel Sample Mobile Install](http://docs-build.sc.couchbase.com:9000/swift#/0/0/1) guide.
          #     - Open the  `docker-componse.yml` and review it (TO CHANGE WITH FINAL IMAGES AVAILABLE)

          - title: Manual
            description: |
              In this lesson, you will install and launch version 2.1 of the Sync Gateway

              **If you would prefer to use a docker container instead, please proceed to the [docker](hhttp://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java/#/0/3/1) section**
             
              - Install Sync Gateway 2.1 from [here](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads) on your platform of choice
              - The Sync Gateway will have to be launched with the config file named `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` that you should have downloaded as part of the [Travel Mobile App install](/develop/swift#/0/1/0). The config file will be located in `/path/to/mobile-travel-sample`.
              - Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json and confirm that the RBAC user credentials configured on the Couchbase Server are used by Sync Gateway for accessing the bucket 
              ```json
              "username": "admin",
              "password": "password",
              ```
              - Launch the Sync Gateway
              
              **macOS**
              ``` bash
              $ cd /path/to/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin
              $ ./sync_gateway /path/to/mobile-travel-sample/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json
              ```
              **Windows**
              - By default, the Sync Gateway service will install with _serviceconfig.json_ config file at this [location](C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\serviceconfig.json)
              - The Sync Gateway will have to be launched with the config file named `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` that you should have downloaded as part of the [Travel Mobile App install](/develop/csharp#/0/1/0). The config file will be located in `c:/path/to/mobile-travel-sample`.
              - Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json and confirm that the RBAC user credentials configured on the Couchbase Server are used by Sync Gateway for accessing the bucket 
              ```json
              "username": "admin",
              "password": "password",
              ```
              - Stop the Sync Gateway service (since it was launched with the default version of config file). To stop the service, you can use the Services application (Control Panel --> Admin Tools --> Services).

              - Replace the _serviceconfig.json_ file located at C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\ with the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json that you downloaded. 
              ``` bash
              $ copy c:/path/to/mobile-travel-sample/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json "C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Sync Gateway\serviceconfig.json"
              ```

              - Start the Sync Gateway service with the new version of _serviceconfig.json_ file. To start the service, you can use the Services application (Control Panel --> Admin Tools --> Services).

              
              ## Try it out

              - Access this URL `http://localhost:4984` in your browser
              - Verify that you get JSON response similar to one below 
                ```json
                {"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":"2.1"},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/2.1.0(775;9cc29c5)"}
                ```


          - title: Docker (Local)
            description: |
              *NOTE* : If you are running the Sync Gateway in a docker container, please make sure that you have the Couchbase Server running in a container as well. If not, please follow instructions [here](/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java#/0/2/1) to install the server container.

              - Create a local docker network named "workshop" if one does not exist already. Open a terminal window and run the following command
                ```bash
                $ docker network ls
                $ docker network create -d bridge workshop
                ```
              -  To run the application in a container, you will first get the docker image from Docker Cloud. 
                ```bash
                $ docker pull connectsv/sync-gateway:2.1.0-enterprise
                ```
              - The Sync Gateway will be launched with the config file named `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` that you should have downloaded as part of the [Travel Mobile App install](/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java#/0/1/0). The config file is located in `/path/to/mobile-travel-sample`.
              - Open the `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` file 
              - For the app to connect to the Couchbase Server, the address of the the server needs to be specified. Note that when you launched the Couchbase Server docker container, you gave it the `name` of "cb-server". Replace the `localhost` in the file with  `cb-server` and save
                
                ```json 
                "server": "http://cb-server:8091"
                ```

              -  Launch the Sync Gateway with the `sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json` file. Once the command has completed you can start the application with the following.
              
                ```bash
                $ cd /path/to/mobile-travel-sample/

                $ docker run -p 4984-4985:4984-4985 --network workshop --name sync-gateway -d -v `pwd`/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json:/etc/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json connectsv/sync-gateway:2.1.0-enterprise -adminInterface :4985 /etc/sync_gateway/sync_gateway.json
                ```
                
              - You can view the logs at any time by running the following command
                ```bash
                $ docker logs sync-gateway
                ```

              - Verify that the docker container named "sync-gateway" is running with the following command in the terminal window
                ```bash
                $ docker ps
                ```

              ### Try it out
              
              - Access this URL `http://localhost:4984` in your browser
              - Verify that you get back a JSON response similar to one below
              ```json
              {"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":"2.0"},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/2.0.0(775;9cc29c5)"}

        milestones:
          - title: Manual
            description: |
              We will use the Python version of the [Travel Sample Web Backend ](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/sdk/python/sample-app-backend.html) which uses the Couchbase Python SDK to with with Couchbase Server Query Services.

              **If you would prefer to use a docker container instead, please proceed to the [docker](http://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java/#/0/4/1) section**

              **Windows Users **
              The instructions in this section are for Windows users. Scroll to "Other Platforms" section for instructions for other platforms. 
              - Install the Couchbase Python SDK Installer. This can be downloaded from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/couchbase/#files) website. Scroll to the section which lists the relevant installers and select the installer corresponding to appropriate version of Python that you have installed on your machine. 
               ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/win_py_installer.png)
              - Clone the 5.0 branch of Travel Sample web app repo
              ```bash
              $ git clone -b 5.0 https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-python.git
              ```         

              - Verify pip installation
              If you are developing on Windows, pip.exe will be found in "Scripts" sub directory under the Python installation directory. Add the path to the "Scripts" folder to the system's PATH environment variable. You can follow instructions [here](https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/) to set your PATH variable.
              Verify that pip is recognized by typing the following in the cmd terminal. You should see the help menu
              ```bash
              pip
              ```

              - The application uses several Python libraries that need to be installed, this are listed in requirements.txt and can be automatically loaded using the pip command
              ``` bash
              cd c:\path\to\try-cb-python
              pip install -r requirements.txt
              ```
        
              - Update the travel.py file to reflect the username and password that you have used during Couchbase Server install. This defaults to "Administrator" and "password"
              ``` python
              DEFAULT_USER = "Administrator"
              PASSWORD = 'password' 
              ```

              - Now launch the Travel Web App
              ``` bash
              $ python travel.py
              $ Running on http://localhost:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
              ```
              You may see an alert similar to one below requesting access to run the app. Make sure you select the "Allow access" option.

              ```bash
              $ git clone -b 5.0 https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-python.git
              ```         

              - We will run the Travel Web App in a Python [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). 
                First, check if `virtualenv` is installed on your system
              ```bash
              $ virtualenv --version
              ```

              - if `virtualenv` is not installed , you can use `apt-get` or `pip` to install it
              ```bash
              $ sudo pip install virtualenv
              ```

              - Specify the folder for your virtual environment
              ```bash
              $ virtualenv /path/to/try-cb-python
              ```
              - Activate your environment. You should see a prompt as shown below
              ```bash
              $ source /path/to/try-cb-python/bin/activate
              $ (try-cb-python) Macintosh-2:try-cb-python mactester$ 
              ```

              - The application uses several Python libraries that need to be installed, this are listed in requirements.txt and can be automatically loaded using the pip command
              ``` bash
              cd /path/to/try-cb-python
              pip install -r requirements.txt
              ```
        
              - Update the travel.py file to reflect the username and password that you have used during Couchbase Server install. This defaults to "Administrator" and "password"
              ``` python
              DEFAULT_USER = "Administrator"
              PASSWORD = 'password' 
              ```

              - Now launch the Travel Web App
              ``` bash
              python travel.py
              * Running on http://localhost:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

              Before diving into the document schemas, let's take a look again at the mobile app. When you ran the mobile app in the previous lesson, you may remember two different options were presented on the login screen:
              
              ![](https://cl.ly/1s2L2Q372d2m/android-login.png)
              
              - **Sync mode**: with the user credentials provided, this user can synchronize documents with Couchbase Server and, in turn, with other users.
              - **Guest / Non Sync mode**: no user credentials are required for this option. This is a local only mode.Documents created in the local database are not synchornized to the Sync Gateway.
              
              ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/travel%20sample%20mobile.png)
              Throughout the next lessons, you will be switching between those two modes to test different functionalities. It's worth noting that the data model is slightly different between those two modes. Let's review the data model for each one.
              
              ### Sync mode  

              Here, the application communicates with Couchbase Server (via Sync Gateway). The documents stored in the Couchbase Server bucket have the following types:
                     
              - `airline`
              - `airport`
              - `hotel`
              - `route`
              - `user`
              
              Except for the **user** document (right on the diagram below), the rest of documents are static/semi-static in nature.
              In the demo app, 
              - The `hotel` and `airport' documents are bundled into a prebuilt couchbase lite database and loaded when the app launches.We will discuss more about locading and using prebuilt databases in the [Pre-built Database](http://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java/#/2/4/0)section of the tutorial.
              - The `airline`, `airport`,`hotel` and `route` documents are NOT synchornized to the mobile app. Instead, they are fetched by the app via the REST webservices API exposed by the Travel Sample Web backend.
              
              ![](https://cl.ly/40330Z0M1k3F/models.png)
                
              ### Guest / Non Sync mode
                
              In guest mode, the mobile app creates a new database for the anonymous user. It is an empty database for storing the list of bookmarked hotels locally. 

              It is conceivable that in a real-world application, a user of the Travel Sample Mobile app may be interested in browsing for hotels in specific locations meeting specific search criteria without having to actually sign up. They could bookmark these hotels and later add them to their trip reservations. These bookmarked hotels could also be shared with other users, for instance with the user making the trip bookings.

              In guest mode, the Couchbase Lite database hosts the following types of documents:
                  
              - `bookmarkedhotels` 
              - `hotel`
                
              ![](https://cl.ly/2l0118183p11/guest-model.png)

          - title: Document Types
            description: |
              Unlike tables, in Couchbase, all the documents are stored in the same namespace. So you typically use an additional property to differentiate between each entity. Let’s call it "type".
              ![](https://cl.ly/1w2D1Z2J0p47/document-types.png)
              
              ## Try it out
              
              - Log into the "Admin Console" of Couchbase Server with same Administrator credentials you used during installation
              - Select the "buckets" option from menu on left
              - Click on "Documents" under the travel-sample bucket
              - Search for document with ID "hotel_10025"
              - Verify that the "type" property of the document is "hotel"

          - title: Document Key/ID
            description: |
              Every document in Couchbase is associated with a unique key that must be provided by the user when the document is created. The key is the unique identifier of the document and can take any format. However, it is recommended that you give it a value that provides some context about the contents of the document.
              For instance, in the travel app data set, the document Key/ID is of the format `{doc.type}_{alphanumeric_string}`. Here `{doc.type}` provides some context of the purpose of the document and in combination with the `{alphanumeric_string}`, it uniquely identifies the string.
              The document Key will be listed as “ID” on Couchbase Server admin console. The key is also referred to as the Document ID.
              
              ![](https://cl.ly/0K3V1q3m3K1Z/admin-ui.png)
              
              ## Try it out
              
              - Log into the "Admin Console" of Couchbase Server with appropriate Administrator credentials you created during installation
              - Select the "buckets" option from the menu on the left 
              - Click on "Documents" under the travel-sample bucket
              - Search for document with ID "airline_137"
              - Verify that the "callsign" property of the document is "AIRFRANS"

          - title: Document _id
            description: |
              When Sync Gateway processes a document, it adds relevant metadata to the document. The metadata includes an "_id" property that corresponds  to the document ID. You will see this property if you query for the document via the the Sync Gateway REST API.
              
              ```json
              {
                  "_id": "airline_137",
                  "_rev": "1-b4e60280a1a0e3d46efad7bfd0e2068c",
                  "callsign": "AIRFRANS",
                  "country": "France",
                  "iata": "AF",
                  "icao": "AFR",
                  "id": 137,
                  "name": "Air France",
                  "type": "airline"
              }
              ```
              
              Mobile App Developers using Couchbase Lite  should typically never have to directly read or write the _id property. You would query the meta().id field to fetch the document ID. We will learn more about this in our lesson on Queries.

          - title: Overview
            description: |
              ### The Model-View-Presenter pattern
              
              In our app, we follow the MVP pattern, separating the internal data model, from a passive view through a presenter that handles the logic of our application and acts as the conduit between the model and the view.
              
              ![](https://cl.ly/073D0j3K1d1P/92ec579c7c197eb1.png)
              
              In the Android Studio project, the code is structured by feature. You can select the **Android** option in the left navigator to view the files by package.
              
              ![](https://cl.ly/1h080V1V2g2j/left-navigator.png)
              
              Each package contains 3 different files:
              
              - `Activity`: This is where all the view logic resides.
              - `Presenter`: This is where all the business logic resides to fetch and persist data to a web service or the embedded Couchbase Lite database.
              - `Contract`: An interface that the `Presenter` and `Activity` implement.
              
              Throughout this tutorial, we will walkthrough the code in the various presenters to showcase different features of the Couchbase Lite 2.0 API: `BookmarksPresenter.java`, `HotelsPresenter.java`, `SearchFlightPresenter.java` and `BookingsPresenter.java`.
              
      - title: The Basics
        milestones:
          - title: Create a Database
            description: |
              There is no limit to how many databases can be created or opened on the device. You can think of a database as a namespace for documents and several databases can be used in the same app (one database per user of the app is a common pattern).
              
              The snippet below creates an empty database for the `guest` user in a directory named `guest`.
              
              **Open the file** `DatabaseManager.java`. We will review the `DatabaseManager(Context context, boolean isGuest)` constructor method.
              
              [DatabaseManager.java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/util/DatabaseManager.java#L38)
              ```java
              protected DatabaseManager(Context context, boolean isGuest) {
                ...
              }
              ```
              We create a folder for the `guest` user database and specify that as the database `directory` in the `DatabaseConfiguration` object
              ```java
              if (isGuest) {
                  DatabaseConfiguration config = new DatabaseConfiguration(context);
                  config.setDirectory(String.format("%s/guest", context.getFilesDir()));
              ```
 
              The Couchbase Lite Database is created with specified name and `DatabaseConfiguration` object
             
              ```java
                  try {
                    database = new Database("travel-sample", config);
                  } catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                  }
               } else {
                      ...
               }
              
              ```
              
              ## Try it out
              
              - Build and Run the Travel Sample Mobile App
              - On Login screen select “Proceed as Guest” option. 
              - This will log you into app in Guest Mode. Signing in as Guest will create a new empty  database for “guest” account if one does not exist
              - Confirm that you see the “BookmarksActivity” page. It will be empty the very first time.
          - title: Create and Update a Document
            description: |
              Bookmarked hotels are persisted in a separate document with the ID of `user::guest`. Every time a hotel is bookmarked, you will persist the document ID of that hotel document on the `hotels` property and the hotel's information inon a separate document.
              
              ```json
              {
                "_id": "hotel1",
                "name": "San Francisco Hotel",
                "address": "123, Park Street, San Francisco"
              }
              
              {
                "type": "bookmarkedhotels",
                "hotels": ["hotel1", "hotel2"]
              }
              ```
              **Open the file** `app/src/android/java/.../hotels/HotelsPresenter.java`. You will review the `bookmarkHotels(Map<String, Object> hotel)` method.
              
              [HotelsPresenter.java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/hotels/HotelsPresenter.java#L110)
              
              ```java
              @Override
              public void bookmarkHotels(Map<String, Object> hotel) {
                ...
              }
              ```
              
              First, you need to get an instance of the database.
              
              ```java
              Database database = DatabaseManager.getDatabase();
              ```
              
              The following snippet persists the hotel instance (`Map<String, Object>`) as a new `Document` in the database. This will allow us to access bookmarked hotel documents while being offline.
              
              ```java
              MutableDocument hotelDoc = new MutableDocument((String) hotel.get("id"), hotel);
              try {
                database.save(hotelDoc);
              } catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
              }
              ```
              
              Next you will get the document with ID `user::guest` or create one if it doesn't exist. The document is created with the `type` property set to `bookmarkedhotels` and a new `hotels` array to store the document IDs of the bookmarked hotels.
      
              Document document = database.getDocument("user::guest");
              MutableDocument mutableCopy = null;
              if (document == null) {
                HashMap<String, Object> properties = new HashMap<>();
                properties.put("type", "bookmarkedhotels");
                properties.put("hotels", new ArrayList<>());
                mutableCopy = new MutableDocument("user::guest", properties);
              }
              else {
                mutableCopy = document.toMutable();
              }
              ```
              
              Next, the selected hotel's ID is added to the `hotels` array.
               
              ```java
              MutableArray hotels =  mutableCopy.getArray("hotels").toMutable();
              mutableCopy.setArray("hotels",hotels.addString((String) hotel.get("id")));
              ```
              
              Finally, you will save the document.
              
              ```java
              try {
                database.save(mutableCopy);
              } catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
              }
              ```
              
              ## Try it out
              
              - As Guest User, tap on “hotels” button
              - In "location" text field , enter "L" as if you were starting to type "London". You will see list of hotels. 
              - The list of hotels is pulled from the Couchbase Server via the Travel Sample Web Services API. The list of hotels is not displayed unless there is an open connection the python web app so make sure you have your Travel Sample Web app running
              - Tap on the first hotel cell to bookmark it
              - Verify that you see the bookmarked hotel in the “BookmarksActivity" screen. A motivation for having separate docs for each bookmarked hotel is if they become sharable between users via the sync function.

          - title: Delete a Document
            description: |
              A document can be deleted using the `delete` method. This operation actually creates a new `tombstoned` revision in order to propagate the deletion to other clients.
              
              **Open the file** in `app/src/android/java/.../bookmarks/BookmarksPresenter.java`. You will review the `removeBookmark(Map<String, Object> bookmark)` method.
              
              [BookmarksPresenter](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/bookmarks/BookmarksPresenter.java#L77)
              
              ```java
              @Override
              public void removeBookmark(Map<String, Object> bookmark) {
                  ...
              }
              ```
              
              When searching for hotels in **Guest mode**, the app sends a GET request to the Python Web App which performs a Full-Text Search query on Couchbase Server. Then, if a hotel is bookmarked, it gets inserted in the Couchbase Lite database for offline access. So when the user unbookmarks a hotel, the document needs to be removed from the database. That's what the code below is doing.
              
              
              ```java
              Database database = DatabaseManager.getDatabase();
              Document document = database.getDocument((String) bookmark.get("id"));
              try {
                database.delete(document);
              } catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
              }
              ```
              
              In addition to deleting the document of type "hotel" as shown above, the unbookmarking process removes the hotel ID from the `hotels` array in the "bookmarkedhotels" document.
              
              ## Try it out
              
              - Follow the steps in [Update a Document](http://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/travel-sample/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java/#/2/1/1) section to bookmark a hotel
              - Confirm that you see two bookmarked hotels in the "Bookmarked Hotels" screen. If not, make sure you go through the instructions in [Update a Document](http://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/travel-sample/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java/#/2/1/1) section 
              - Swipe left on first Hotel cell to unbookmark/remove the cell
              - Verify that you see a single hotel in the list

              - Data Synchronization and Routing
              - Authorization and Access Control
              
              In this chapter, we will focus on Authorization and Access Control. We will discuss Data Synchronization and Routing in the [Sync](/develop/swift#/2/3/0) chapter.
             
              In the "Installation" guide, we walked you through the steps to launch Sync Gateway with a specific config file. The Sync Gateway configuration file determines the runtime behavior of Sync Gateway.

              Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json file located at https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json.

              - The `users` section defines the hardcoded list of users who are granted access. It includes the "demo" user that we created via the Travel Web App in the "User Management" section. "tester" and "admin" users are also configured.
              Note that in a real world app, when a user registers via the web app, the web app would use the Sync Gateway REST API to dynamically create the user. 
              ```javascript
               "users":{
                  "admin": {"password": "password", "admin_channels": ["*"]}, 
                  "demo": {"password": "password"},
                  "tester": {"password": "password"}
                }
              ```

              - The `sync function` in the config file is a JavaScript function which implements the access control logic. The `access` method is used to grant the current user access to specific channel. We will discuss channels in detail in the ["Sync"](/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java#/2/3/0) section. For now, it is sufficient to note that documents are associated with channel(s). So access to a document is controlled by controlling the access rights to a channel.

              ``` JavaScript
              // Give user read access to channel
              if (!isDelete()) {
                // Deletion of user document is essentially deletion of user
                access(username,"channel." + username)
              }
              ```
            
              ## Try it out
            
              - Run the following command in yout terminal. If you did a cloud based install, please replace `localhost` in the command below with the IP Address of the cloud instance of the Sync Gateway.
              ```bash
              curl -X GET http://localhost:4984/travel-sample/
              ```
              - Confirm that you see an "Unauthorized" error from the server
              -  Run the following command in yout terminal. The `authorization` header is base64 encoded value of "demo:password". If you did a cloud based install, please replace `localhost` in the command below with the IP Address of the cloud instance of the Sync Gateway.
              ```bash
              curl -X GET http://localhost:4984/travel-sample/ -H 'authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwYXNzd29yZA=='
              ```
              - Confirm that you see the details of the "travel-sample" database and "state" is "online"

          - title: Channels/Data Routing
            description: |
              In the lesson on [Access Control](/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java#/2/2/1) we discussed how the Couchbase Sync Gateway supports Authorization and Access Control functions. In this lesson we discuss how it can be used for Data Synchronization and Routing.
     
              A Sync Gateway configuration file determines the runtime behavior of Sync Gateway, including server configuration and the database or set of databases with which a Sync Gateway instance can interact. 

              - Sync Gateway uses channels to make it easy to share a database between a large number of users and control access to the database. Conceptually, a channel could be viewed as a tag. Every document in the database belongs to a set of channels, and a user is granted appropriate access a set of channels. A channel is used to  

                - Partition the data set
                - Authorize users to access documents.
                - Minimize the amount of data synced down to devices.


              In the "Installation" guide, we walked you through the steps to launch Sync Gateway with a specific config file.
              Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json file located at https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json. It includes the `sync function` which is a JavaScript function whose source code is stored in the Sync Gateway's database configuration file.
    
              ```javascript
              /* Routing */
              // Add doc to the user's channel.
              channel("channel." + username);

              ```
          
          - title: XAttrs
            description: |
              Before you begin this lesson, confirm that you have the Sync Gateway up and running by following the instructions in the ["Installation"](/tutorials/travel-sample/develop/java#/0/4/0) section.

            
              Starting with Sync Gateway 1.5 and Couchbase Server 5.0, mobile and server/web applications now have the ability to read and write to the same bucket. It is an opt-in feature that can be enabled in the Sync Gateway configuration file.
             
              ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/convergence.png)
         
             
              Prior to 1.5, sync metadata used by the Sync Gateway for replication with mobile clients was included within the documents as part of the `_sync` property. 
              In 1.5, the sync metadata is moved into the Extended Attributes or XAttrs associated with the document. 

             
              This can be enabled through a configuration setting in the sync gateway config file
              Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json file located at https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json

              ```javascript
              "import_docs": "continuous",
              "enable_shared_bucket_access":true
              ```

              You can specify the Couchbase Server documents that need to be imported and processed by the Sync Gateway.
              In our demo, we will only be synchornizing the "user" document. So every other document type is ignored.
              ```javascript
              "import_filter": `
              function(doc) {
                /* Just ignore all the static travel-sample files */
                if (doc._deleted == true ) {
                  return true;
                 }
                if (doc.type == "landmark" || doc.type == "hotel" || doc.type == "airport" || doc.type =="airline" || doc.type == "route") {
                  return false;
                } 
              
                return true;
              }`,
              ```

          - title: Replication
            description: |
              Replication is the process by which clients running Couchbase Lite synchronize database changes with the remote (server)  database.
              
              - Pull Replication is the process by which clients running Couchbase Lite download database changes from the remote (server) source database to the local target database
              - Push Replication is the process by which clients running Couchbase Lite upload database changes from the local source database to the remote (server) target database 
              
              Couchbase Mobile 2.0 introduces a brand new replication protocol which is implemented as a messaging protocol layered over WebSocket. 
              ![](http://blog.couchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/replication2.0.png)
              
              The replication process can be “continuous” or “one shot“.
              - In “Continuous” replication mode, the changes are continually synchronized between the client and Sync Gateway.
              
              - In “One shot” mode, the changes are synchronized once and the connection between the client and server disconnects. When any future changes need to be pushed up or pulled down, the client must start a new replication.
              
              **Open the file** `app/src/android/java/.../util/DatabaseManager.java`. We will review the method `startPushAndPullReplicationForCurrentUser(String username, String password)`.

              [DatabaseManager.java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/util/DatabaseManager.java#L131)
              
              ```java
              public static void startPushAndPullReplicationForCurrentUser(String username, String password) {
                ...
              }
              ```
              
              First, you initialize the `URL` object which points to the Sync Gateway instance to synchronize with.
              
              ```java
              public static String mSyncGatewayEndpoint = "ws://10.0.2.2:4984/travel-sample";
              URI url = null;
              try {
                  url = new URI(mSyncGatewayEndpoint);
              } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
                  e.printStackTrace();
              }
              ```

              Next, you will configure the replication. The `ReplicatorConfiguration` is initialized with the local database and URL of the target DB on Sync Gateway. The `replicatorType` in the Replicator Config specifies the type of replication. In the code snippet in the Travel App, it is `pushAndPull` indicating that both push and pull replication is enabled. The `continuous` mode is set to `true` in the Travel app.

              ```java

              ReplicatorConfiguration config = new ReplicatorConfiguration(database, new URLEndpoint(url));
              config.setReplicatorType(ReplicatorConfiguration.ReplicatorType.PUSH_AND_PULL);
              config.setContinuous(true);
              ```
              
              The Replicator is configured with relevant authentication credentials. In the Travel app, the list of users that are permitted access is configured in the Sync Gateway configuration file as discussed in the [Access Control](/develop/swift#/2/2/1) section
          
              ```java
              config.setAuthenticator(new BasicAuthenticator(username, password));
              ```

              The Replicator is initialized with the specified configuration 
              
              ```java
              Replicator replicator = new Replicator(config);
              ```

              A change listener callback block is registered to listen for replication changes. Every time, there is a push or pull change, the callback is invoked. 

              ```java
              replicator.addChangeListener(new ReplicatorChangeListener() {
              @Override
              public void changed(ReplicatorChange change) {

                  if (change.getReplicator().getStatus().getActivityLevel().equals(Replicator.ActivityLevel.IDLE)) {

                      Log.e("Replication Comp Log", "Schedular Completed");

                  }
                  if (change.getReplicator().getStatus().getActivityLevel().equals(Replicator.ActivityLevel.STOPPED) || change.getReplicator().getStatus().getActivityLevel().equals(Replicator.ActivityLevel.OFFLINE)) {
                      // stopReplication();
                      Log.e("Rep schedular  Log", "ReplicationTag Stopped");
                  }
              }
              });
              ```
              
              Replication is started
              
              ```java
              replicator.start();
              ```
              
              ## Try it out (Push Replication)
              
              - Log into the Travel Sample Mobile app as “demo” user and password as “password”
              - Tap the "airline" button to make a flight reservation. Both the "From" and "To" airports and flight dates are already set.
              - Tap the "lookup" button
              - From list of flights, select the first flight listing. This automatically confirms the booking.
              - Access the Travel Sample Web app. The URL would be [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). If you did cloud based install, please replace `localhost` in the URL  with the IP Address of the cloud instance of the web app.
              - Make sure that the "New User" checkbox is **unchecked**
              - Log into the web app as “demo” user with password as “password”
              - Use the "headshot" button (2nd from the right) to  navigate to the list of booked flights
              - Confirm that you see the flight that you reserved via the mobile app in your list of flights in the web app

              ![](https://cl.ly/3r0X2x1M3k37/android-push.gif)

              ## Try it out (Pull Replication)
              
              - Access the Travel Sample Web app. The URL would be [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). If you did cloud based install, please replace `localhost` in the URL  with the IP Address of the cloud instance of the web app.

              - Log into the web app as “demo” user with password as “password”
              - Make a flight reservation by clicking the "booking" button (the paper airplane).
              - Enter “From” airport as "SFO" and select the airport from drop down menu.
              - Enter “To” airport as "LHR" and select the airport from drop down menu.
              - Enter From and Return Travel Dates
              - Click on "Find Flights" button
              - From list of flights, select the first flight listing
              - Confirm the booking by clicking on the shopping cart icon and then the “Book” button
              - Log into the Travel Sample Mobile app as “demo” user and password as “password”    
              - Confirm that you see the flight that you reserved via the web app in your list of flights in the mobile app

          - title: Starting with Prebuilt Database
            description: |
              In this section, you will learn how to bundle a pre-built Couchbase Lite database in an application. It can be a lot more efficient to bundle static or semi-static content database in your application and install it on the first launch. Even if some of the content changes on the server after you create the app, the app's first pull replication will bring the database up to date.
              Here, you will use a pre-built database that contains only airport and hotel documents. The code below moves the pre-built database from the bundled location to the Application Support directory.
              
              **Open the file** `app/src/android/java/.../util/DatabaseManager.java` and navigate to the database constructor.
              
              This method first checks if a database file already exists. If it doesn't exist it loads the database from the assets directory.
              
              [DatabaseManager.java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/util/DatabaseManager.java#L49)
              
              ```java
              protected DatabaseManager(Context context, boolean isGuest) {
                  if (isGuest) {
                      ...
                  } else {
                      File dbFile = new File(context.getFilesDir(), "travel-sample.cblite2");
                      if (!dbFile.exists()) {
                          DatabaseManager.installPrebuiltDatabase(context, "travel-sample.cblite2.zip");
                      }
                      DatabaseConfiguration config = new DatabaseConfiguration(context);
                      try {
                          database = new Database("travel-sample", config);
                          ...

                          e.printStackTrace();
                      }
                  }
              }

              - Log into the Travel Sample Mobile app as “demo” user and password as “password”
              - Tap on  "Airplane” button to make a flight reservation
              - In the “From”  airport text field, enter “London”
              - Confirm that the first item in the dropdown list is "London St Pancras" (a train station!)

      - title: Query
        milestones:
          - title: Overview
            description: |
              Couchbase Lite 2.0 includes support for N1QL like query interface. Database can be queried by constructing a query using a Query builder  and then executing that query.

              The Query interface in Couchbase Lite 2.0 is poweful and includes support for the following among others
              - Pattern Matching 
              - Regex Matching
              - Math Functions
              - String Manipulation Functions
              - Aggregate Functions
              - Grouping
              - Joins (within single database)
              - Sorting
              - NilOrMissing properties

          - title: Simple Query
            description: |
              The travel app has many instances of querying the database. We will discuss a simple example here.

              **Open the file** `app/src/android/java/.../searchflight/SearchFlightPresenter.java`. We will review the `startsWith(String prefix, String tag)` method.
              
              [SearchFlightPresenter.java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/searchflight/SearchFlightPresenter.java#L53)
              
              ```java
              @Override
              public void startsWith(String prefix, String tag) {
                ...
              }
              ```
              The query below **selects** the "name" property in documents **from** the database **where** the **type** property is equal to **airport** and the "airportname" property is equal to the search term.
          
              ```java
              Database database = DatabaseManager.getDatabase();
              Query searchQuery = QueryBuilder
                .select(SelectResult.expression(Expression.property("airportname")))
                .from(DataSource.database(database))
                .where(
                  Expression.property("type").equalTo(Expression.string("airport"))
                    .and(Expression.property("airportname").like(Expression.string(prefix + "%")))
              );
              ```
            
              Next, the query is executed using the `execute()` method. Each row in the result will contain a single property called "airportname". The final result is passed to the `showAirports` method where the result will be displayed in a `RecyclerView`.
              
              ```java
              ResultSet rows = null;
              try {
                  rows = searchQuery.execute();
              } catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
                  Log.e("app", "Failed to run query", e);
                  return;
              }
      
              Result row;
              List<String> data = new ArrayList<>();
              while ((row = rows.next()) != null) {
                  data.add(row.getString("airportname"));
              }
              mSearchView.showAirports(data, tag);       
              ```
          
              ## Try it out
              
              - Log into the Travel Sample Mobile app as "demo" user and password as "password"
              - Tap the "Flights" button to make a flight reservation
              - In the "From" airport textfield, enter "Detroit"
              - Verify that the first item in the drop down list is "Detroit Metro Wayne Co"

          - title: Advanced Query 
            description: |
              In this section we will discuss the JOIN query. JOIN Queries in Couchbase Lite 2.0 are intra-database joins.
              
              If you recall from the Data Modeling section, the document with a **type** equal to "bookmarkedhotels" contains a **hotels** property which is an array of IDs of bookmarked hotels.
              
              ```json
              {
                "_id": "hotel1",
                "name": "San Francisco Hotel",
                "address": "123, Park Street, San Francisco"
              }
              
              {
                "type": "bookmarkedhotels",
                "hotels": ["hotel1", "hotel2"]
              }
              ```
              
              We will review the query that fetches documents whose `_id` is included in the "hotels" property array of the document of type "bookmarkedhotels".
              
              **Open the file** `app/src/android/java/.../hotes/BookmarksPresenter.java`. We will review the `fetchBookmarks()` method.
               
              [BookmarksPresenter.java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/bookmarks/BookmarksPresenter.java#L32)
              
              ```java
              public void fetchBookmarks() {
                ...
              }
              ```
              
              First, we instantiate two data sources which corresponds to the two sides of the join query.
              
              ```java
              DataSource bookmarkDS = DataSource.database(database).as("bookmarkDS");
              DataSource hotelsDS = DataSource.database(database).as("hotelDS");
              ```
              
              Next we write the query expressions. The first one gets the `hotels` property on the bookmarks data source. The seconds get the document ID on the hotels data source.
              
              ```java
              Expression hotelsExpr = Expression.property("hotels").from("bookmarkDS");
              Expression hotelIdExpr = Meta.id.from("hotelDS");
              ```
              
              Next, we use a function expression to find document's whose `_id` property is in the `hotels` array. And build the join expression.
              
              ```java
              Expression joinExpr = ArrayFunction.contains(hotelsExpr, hotelIdExpr);
              Join join = Join.join(hotelsDS).on(joinExpr);
              ```
              
              Finally, the query object uses that join expression to find all the hotel document referenced in the "hotels" array of the bookmark document.
              
              ```java
              Expression typeExpr = Expression.property("type").from("bookmarkDS");
      
              SelectResult bookmarkAllColumns = SelectResult.all().from("bookmarkDS");
              SelectResult hotelsAllColumns = SelectResult.all().from("hotelDS");
      
              Query query = QueryBuilder
                .select(bookmarkAllColumns, hotelsAllColumns)
                .from(bookmarkDS)
                .join(join)
                .where(typeExpr.equalTo(Expression.string("bookmarkedhotels")));
              ```

              We use the `execute()` method to get the results and pass them on to the view.
              
              ```java
              query.addChangeListener(new QueryChangeListener() {
                  @Override
                  public void changed(QueryChange change) {
                      ResultSet rows = change.getRows();
      
                      List<Map<String, Object>> data = new ArrayList<>();
                      Result row = null;
                      while((row = rows.next()) != null) {
                          Map<String, Object> properties = new HashMap<>();
                          properties.put("name", row.getDictionary("hotelDS").getString("name"));
                          properties.put("address", row.getDictionary("hotelDS").getString("address"));
                          properties.put("id", row.getDictionary("hotelDS").getString("id"));
                          data.add(properties);
                      }
                      mBookmarksView.showBookmarks(data);
                  }
              });
      
              try {
                  query.execute();
              } catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
                  e.printStackTrace();
              }
              ```
               
              ## Try it out
              
              - Log into the Travel Sample Mobile app as "Guest" user by selecting "Proceed as Guest"
              - Tap on  "Hotels"" button 
              - In the "Location" text field, enter "London"
              - In the "Description" text field, enter "Pets"
              - Verify that you see the "Novotel London West" listed
              - Tap to "bookmark" the hotel
              - Verify that the Novatel hotel shows up in the list on the "BookmarksActivity" page

          - title: Full Text Search
            description: |
              Couchbase Lite 2.0 now supports Full Text Search (FTS). FTS is accomplished using the `match` query. FTS matches are case-senstive. In the Travel App, the FTS query is against local "travel-sample" documents that is pre-built with the app.

              In order to do FTS queries, an FTS index must be created.
              
              **Open the file** `app/src/android/java/.../util/DatabaseManager.java`. We will review the `createFTSQueryIndex()` method. This code snippet creates an FTS index on the property named `description`.
              
              [DatabaseManager.java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/util/DatabaseManager.java#L76)
              
              ```java
              private void createFTSQueryIndex() {
                  try {
                      database.createIndex("descFTSIndex", IndexBuilder.fullTextIndex(FullTextIndexItem.property("description")));
                  } catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
                      e.printStackTrace();
                  }
              }
              ```
              
              Next you will write an FTS query that uses the index.
              
              **Open the file** `app/src/android/java/.../hotels/HotelsPresenter.java`. We will review the `queryHotels(String location, String description)` method.
              
              [HotelsPresenter.java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/android/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/travelsample/hotels/HotelsPresenter.java)

              ```java
              @Override
              public void queryHotels(String location, String description) {
                ...
              }
              ```

              First, you get an instance of the database.
              
              ```java
              Database database = DatabaseManager.getDatabase();
              ```
              
              Next, you will create an FTS `Expressions` using the `match()` operator.  In this particular example, the `match` expression looks for the `desciptionStr` value in the `description` property. This `match` expression is logically ANDed with an `equalTo` comparison expression which looks for the `location` in the `country`,`city`,`state` or `address` properties. This expression is then used in the `where` clause of the query the usual way.
              
              ```java
              Expression descExp = FullTextExpression.index("descFTSIndex").match(description) ;
    
      
              Expression locationExp = Expression.property("country")
                .like(Expression.string("%" + location + "%"))
                .or(Expression.property("city").like(Expression.string("%" + location + "%")))
                .or(Expression.property("state").like(Expression.string("%" + location + "%")))
                .or(Expression.property("address").like(Expression.string("%" + location + "%")));
      
              Expression searchExp = descExp.and(locationExp);
      
              Query hotelSearchQuery = QueryBuilder
                .select(SelectResult.all())
                .from(DataSource.database(database))
                .where(
                    Expression.property("type").equalTo(Expression.string("hotel")).and(searchExp)
              );
              ```
              
              We build the query using the different expressions from above and transform the `ResultSet` object into a `List<Map<String, Object>>` object that is passed to the `RecyclerView`.
              
              ```java
              ResultSet rows = null;
              try {
                  rows = hotelSearchQuery.execute();
              } catch (CouchbaseLiteException e) {
                  e.printStackTrace();
                  return;
              }
      
              List<Map<String, Object>> data = new ArrayList<Map<String, Object>>();
              Result row = null;
              while((row = rows.next()) != null) {
                  Map<String, Object> properties = new HashMap<String, Object>();
                  properties.put("name", row.getDictionary("travel-sample").getString("name"));
                  properties.put("address", row.getDictionary("travel-sample").getString("address"));
                  data.add(properties);
              }
              mHotelView.showHotels(data);
              ```
              
              ## Try it out
            
              - Log into the Travel Sample Mobile app as “demo” user and password as “password”
              - Tap on "hotels" button
              - In the description text field enter “Pets.
              - In the Location text field enter "London"
              - Verify that you see one hotel listed named "Novotel London West"
